terrain system:
    reduce terrain height cost somehow:
        idk how to make terrain like layered noise without layering noise
    rom defined terrain layers:
        each possible texture layer from 0 to whatever the max block ID is are written directly in a processor
        faster than if else chains, and modular
    biomes:
        different biomes, each with their own texture rom, props, and terrain scale properties (these should blend ideally)

UI:
    Inventory:
        The gui itself
        Item slots:
            including a count display if count > 1
    Crafting:
        idk how, but it's needed

Held Item Rendering:
    A custom model for each item when in hand
    Pre-sorted (or entirely pre-computed?) and rendered just under the UI

Objects:
    Make objects run VM code:
        sfmlog based assembler for parsing VM assembly

Content:
    Items:
        Resources:
            props and enemies give resources
        Tools
        Weapons
        Equipment
    Enemies
    Structures
    Props:
        more of them
